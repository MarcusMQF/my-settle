# MySettle

> 🏆 Digital ID Solution Hackathon Project

**MySettle** is a digital accident resolution platform that enables Malaysian drivers to report minor road accidents without visiting a police station and complicated procedure — all verified through **MyDigital ID**.

## 🚗 Problem Statement

Traditional accident reporting requires drivers to:
- Wait at the accident scene for hours
- Visit police stations for paperwork
- Deal with lengthy manual verification processes

## 💡 Our Solution

1. **Digital Handshake** - Both drivers verify identity via QR code + MyDigital ID
2. **Document Accident** - Capture photos, describe the incident, provide scene details
3. **Submit to PDRM** - Digitally sign and submit report directly to Police
4. **PDRM Review** - Police evaluates report within 24 hours
